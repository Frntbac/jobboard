## Your job

**You’ll join a team of 6 developers and a CTO located in Brussels & Bujumbura (Burundi).** Together, we’ll work on our various web applications written in PHP, Ruby and JavaScript (and soon mobile development in Android). **You’ll help the more junior team members** with good practices and support their growth using code review and pair programming. This will not only help us deliver our projects, but also do it better.

You will be expected to take a lead on the technical development of product roadmaps.

**You’ll join in-country missions 3-4 time a year** (together with a member of our business team) and help customers get started with our software - testing in real conditions and getting insight on their needs directly from the field.

## Your profile

**You have experience with and like to coach junior developers.** You’ve seen different development teams, and know how they could work better. You keep yourself up-to-date on the latest technologies, packages or practices and use the best solutions for your projects.
