# Ruby and Angular.js lead developer

Commuty (https://commuty.net) is a young recently seeded startup that is tackling mobility problems of our society. We focus on commutes as they are the main cause of today’s mobility problems. We build mobility tools for the B2B market. In other words, we help companies change their employees commute habits. We have a truckload of ideas that don’t necessarily apply to B2B but we are missing a few more smart people in our team to get it to the next level.

Commuty has several large customers in Belgium, including a couple of companies in the BEL20. In the near future, we want to grow our customer base and move forward with new challenges.

As a software developer at Commuty, you’ll have the opportunity to work with the following tech:

* Ruby on Rails
* Angular.js
* Node.js
* Ionic framework
* Postgresql
* Docker

This is the stack that we use now, but you will be encouraged to use whatever else you feel like that delivers value to the project! Our system is a set of several micro-services interacting together. Some parts will be open-sourced soon (with your help?).

## Your role will involve

* Helping shape our products based on customer’s feedback
* Building MVP’s for new product ideas
* Developing custom services for our customers
* Implementing new ideas and concepts in existing products
* Working closely with the folks at SPIN42 that are taking good care of our platform at the moment
* Helping open-source some parts of our system
* Being as awesome as you can be

## What we offer

Now let’s be honest, we won’t lie, there is no way we can offer you the salary package of a large consultancy company so let’s put it this way:

* We will pay you a fair salary (yay!)
* You will work decent and normal hours, we don’t need a caffeinated monkey, we need a well rested, clear headed team member
* You’ll work with and will be helped by experienced developers (the SPIN42 team)
* Your opinion will be very important, we need a partner, not a code-pisser
* You’ll be working on a real society problem, not some potential 1M€/month cash cow mumbo jumbo
* You can negotiate your perks, just talk to us
* We will trust you

## Who should apply?

We’re more looking for attitude than pure skills. If you’re a true smart learner with little experience in product development, talk to us. If you already have experience, then we will gladly welcome you as well.  We can offer both employed and/or freelance positions, it’s up to you.

## How to apply?

Drop us a line at wewantyou@commuty.net
You can send a resume, but showing us code or any acomplishments (talks, blog posts, ...) that you are proud of would be better.
